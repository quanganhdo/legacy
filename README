A collection of scripts I wrote years and years ago.

# 360xport

A bookmarklet to export blog posts from Yahoo! 360 (when it was still a living thing) to WordPress.

# 800

A WordPress theme to display a random funny story on each page load. 800 is the character limit of a Yahoo! Messenger message. Keeping those stories well under 800 characters make them easy to be shared.

# e3

Another bookmarklet to insert emoticons in BBQuote or HTML to the comment area of a blog or forum post. Don't remember why I named it that way though.

# greasemonkey

Tons of greasemonkey scripts I wrote back in the day to tweak Tumblr, Yahoo! 360, etc

# learn

Give you a random link to WikiHow on each page load. Learn something new today, get it?

# luteous

A CSS editor for Yahoo! Mash, another failed production from Yahoo!

# wordclock

A JavaScript remake of the other Flash-powered wordclock.
